# Dice Crunch

## Overview

**Dice Crunch** provides players the ability to simulate polyhedral die rolls with a variety of
useful math operations. Create formulas for multiple die, add, subtract, drop the lowest roll,
and more! Save die formulas that you want to use often for quick access.

Users will be able to:
* Tap buttons to create flexible, die-rolling formulas.
* Save formulas with descriptive names in a customizable directory structure.
* Tap a saved formula to quickly roll its results.
* Create custom die with an unlimited number of descriptive faces.
* Use a custom die with a single tap of a calculator button.
* Scroll through a history of rolls that show the saved formula's name (if present), the formula
  that was used, and the result from that roll.
* Re-roll a past formula by tapping a button on the history screen.
* After creating a formula, watch the animated die try spin up to 20 die at once to generate
  the results.
* Gently shake your phone to re-roll the animation die tray, generating a new result.
* Tap a re-roll button on the die tray to instantly generate a new result without the spinning
  animation.
